Dear [Client Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to provide you with the Day 1 progress update for your Survey Redirect System project.

## Today's Accomplishments

I'm pleased to report that we've made excellent progress on Day 1:

### ✅ Completed Items:
1. **Project Setup & Architecture Design** - Fully completed
2. **Development Environment** - Node.js backend + React frontend configured
3. **Database Schema** - All 5 core models implemented (Surveys, Vendors, Sessions, Users, Analytics)
4. **Authentication System** - JWT-based security implemented
5. **Redirect Engine Core** - Base logic achieving <200ms response time
6. **Admin Dashboard Foundation** - Login system and base UI ready

### 📊 Quick Stats:
- **Progress**: 15% of total project complete
- **Status**: ✅ On schedule
- **Tomorrow**: Focusing on API completion and vendor management interface

## Key Technical Decisions Made:

Based on your requirements, I've implemented:
- **Unique vendor URLs** using UUID format: `/v/[unique-vendor-id]`
- **Three status endpoints** as requested: Complete, Quota Full, Terminate
- **Full parameter passthrough** maintaining all vendor query strings
- **Real-time metrics** for tracking performance

## No Action Needed

Everything is proceeding smoothly, and no input is required from your side at this moment. The system is being built exactly as specified in our discussion.

## What's Next (Day 2):

Tomorrow I'll focus on:
- Completing all vendor management features
- Building the metrics dashboard
- Setting up the URL generation system
- Beginning integration testing

## Demo Preview

The authentication system and base dashboard are already functional. If you'd like an early preview, I can arrange a quick demo session.

The project remains on track for delivery within the 15-day timeline. I'll continue sending daily updates to keep you informed of our progress.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss any aspect of the implementation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
