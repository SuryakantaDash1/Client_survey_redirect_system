- Added automatic session cleanup so old sessions don't pile up
- Built the analytics part that calculates metrics for the dashboard
- Made some tweaks to speed up the redirect process

### Frontend Work
- Got the dashboard charts working - you can now see all the stats visually
- Finished the vendor management screens where you add/edit vendors
- Added proper error messages when users fill forms incorrectly
- Made the URL generation work - it creates unique links for each vendor

### Testing Setup
- Set up the testing tools so we can catch bugs early
- Wrote some basic tests for the important functions
- Tested the full redirect flow from vendor entry to exit
